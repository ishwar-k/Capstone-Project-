# Capstone-Project-
Your client is a retail banking institution. Term deposits are a major source of income for a bank.
You are provided with the client data such as : age of the client, their job type, their marital status, etc. 
Along with the client data, you are also provided with the information of the call such as the duration of the call, day and month of the call, etc. 
Given this information, your task is to predict if the client will subscribe to term deposit


In this Project using Jupyter Notebook:
1. We will first explore the dataset provided
2. We will create models to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. 
3. We will also make predictions for the clients in the test set which you can submit in the solution_checker.xlsx file to generate accuracy score. 

Use Tableau for Visualizations.
